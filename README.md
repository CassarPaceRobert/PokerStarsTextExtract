# Poker Stars Text Extract Script
This is a Python script that reads through all of the inputted text files from a poker game on PokerStars and extracts the cards of each user based on the hand ID.

Steps to run the script successfully:
1) Place all of the text files in a folder named 'textFiles'
2) Run the Python script through the IDE's terminal by using the command: python textExtract.py
3) The program should create a file named 'finalFile.txt' in the same path with the extracted information

N.B: Make sure that the text files have no special or invisible characters at the top of the file, otherwise, the script will output incorrect results.
